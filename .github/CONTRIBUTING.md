# Welcome to ps2.gg!

Thank you for considering to contribute to our project! Any contribution helps to make life better for the hundreds of players that use our software ♥️

This guide will help you find the best way to deliver your idea.

<br>

## Getting Started

Ask yourself how big of a change you want to contribute.

### Small contributions

If it's a small change or bugfix, you can start right away by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/ps2gg/ps2.gg/issues/new) and opening a new branch that we'll merge in as soon as possible.

### Significant features

If the contribution can be split up into smaller components, we consider it a new project which we will work through [in sprints](/docs/Workflow.md).<br>
In that case, please [contact us on Discord](https://discord.gg/8MvTaUQM2E), so we can plan through the project together and assist you all the way from start to finish.
