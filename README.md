<br>

This is the home of ps2.gg, where UI mods are made that turn Planetside into a better game.<br>
This monorepo includes all microservices used to serve the website, overlay and auxiliary applications.

<br>

## Development

Need help to get started?

[Hit us up on Discord!](https://discord.gg/8MvTaUQM2E) We'll guide you through any part of the development process, so you can focus on building features.
<br>

The [/docs](/docs) folder also contains step-by-step guides to get you started in every type of project.

<br>

## Deployment

The following scripts will get you started with a running stack:
<br>
`bash build.sh [dev/prod/staging]` will build the necessary files
<br>
`bash deploy.sh [dev/prod/staging]` will deploy the stack to Docker Swarm
<br>

### Requirements

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) in Swarm Mode.
* [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/cli/install) as npm replacement (it's fast, like really fast)
* The required docker secrets (see table below)
  <br>

**Please note**: Not all services are open source, so you may need to adjust the docker-compose.yml to match your level of access. (accessibilities are described in the table below)
