# ps2.gg

This is the home of ps2.gg, where UI mods are made that turn Planetside into a better game.<br>
This monorepo includes all microservices used to serve the website and overlay.

<br>

## Development

Need help to get started?

[Hit us up on Discord!](https://discord.gg/8MvTaUQM2E) We'll guide you through any part of the development process, so you can focus on building features.
<br>

The [/docs](/docs) folder also contains step-by-step guides to get you started in every type of project.

<br>

## Deployment

The following scripts will get you started with a running stack:
<br>
`bash build.sh [dev/prod]` will build the necessary files
<br>
`bash deploy.sh [dev/prod]` will deploy the stack to Docker Swarm
<br>

### Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) in Swarm Mode.
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/cli/install) as npm replacement (it's fast, like really fast)
- The required docker secrets (see table below)
  <br>

**Please note**: Not all services are open source, so you may need to adjust the [docker-compose.yml](/docker/compose/out/docker-compose.dev.yml) to match your level of access. (accesibilities are described in the table below)
