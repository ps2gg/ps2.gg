# Fundamental definition of done

This document defines the standards that every piece of code has to fulfill before being accepted as completed.<br>
Some requirements are enforced automatically (i.e. build tests, linting, etc) and are not listed for manual approval.

<br>

## Universal requirements

- Acceptance tests are passed
- Every user/service-facing endpoint is covered in automated tests
- Every non-trivial function is unit tested
- If something takes more than a minute to test manually, it must be automated
- Approval of the product owner and code owners
