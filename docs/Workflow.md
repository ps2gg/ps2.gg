# Our work process

Thank you for showing an interest in our project. We want to make sure everyone has a good time working with us, so we follow a consistent workflow that keeps your workload reasonably sized and always lets you know what everyone else is up to.

<br>

## 1) Planning a feature

When defining our features, we look for **single use cases** that are complex enough that they have to be broken down into smaller components. For example, an "alt wide friends list" or an "inofficial ranked mode".
<br>

### 1.1) Splitting up milestones

Then, we split them up into the next smallest use case, for example "maintaining each players friends list" - and further "linking alts to player's friends". We continue doing this until we can't make the component any smaller without going into implementation specifics.
<br>

### 1.2) Defining our Sprints

The result is a tree with several layers that we can progressively work through in sprints. Each sprint being focused around the most atomic parts of every layer, which we track as issues on Github. We work through them one layer at a time until we completed the feature.
<br>

### Naming Conventions

Each branch of that tree is tracked as a milestone on Github, like:<br>
**Friends-L1-B1** "Maintains an alt-wide friends list"<br>
Where `L` identifies the layer and `B` identifies the branch in the tree.

<br>

## 2) Sprint planning

As described, each sprint covers the smallest issues of every layer in the feature tree.

Everyone is free to choose what they'd like to work on. It doesn't matter if there are one or five people working on the same issue. Just pick the ones that suit your interests and abilities.

We don't force sprints into a timeframe. Rather, we're done when we delivered an acceptable result.

<br>

## 3) Daily standup

In our daily standups, everyone reports their progress and what they'll do next. This is also the best opportunity to address difficulties you may have encountered. It's a constructive process where everyone's opinion is welcome.

<br>

## 4) Sprint review

When all issues are completed, we take a look back at what everyone has accomplished, where we are now, and what can be done next.<br>
This is typically the time where we ship features to production too, so we can discuss the feedback we gained from our users as well.

<br>

## 5) Sprint retrospective

In our retrospective, we address how frictionless and rewarding the sprint has felt. Everyone gets to rate the sprint on both of these criteria on a scale from 0-10 and explain what they may have struggled with or what they'd like to see improved. We then keep track of these concerns as an issue on Github and pin it to the top of our next sprint board, so we never lose track of it.

<br>

## 6) Repeat

Next, we repeat the process and continuously improve our workflow. Ideally, we'd have as much fun writing the software as our users have using it ðŸ˜Š
