# Our work process

We employ a lightweight version of Scrum to achieve consistent results.<br>
In essence, the process looks like this:

<br>

## 1) Breaking down complex problems

To define our projects, we look at **single use cases** that are complex enough to be broken down into minimal pieces.<br>
Our goal is to have every component tracked as an issue on Github.

<br>

## 2) Sprint planning

We look for overarching goals and select a portion of the issues to resolve in our next sprint.<br>
Everyone in the team may then select a number of issues they'd like to work on. <br>
It doesn't matter if there are one or five people working on the same issue. Just pick the ones that suit your interests and abilities.

Our sprints aren't forced into a timeframe. Rather, we're done when we delivered an acceptable result.

<br>

## 3) Daily standup

In our daily standups, everyone reports their progress and what they'll do next. This is also the best opportunity to address difficulties you may have encountered. It's a constructive process where everyone's opinion is welcome.

<br>

## 4) Sprint review

When all issues are completed, we take a look back at what everyone has accomplished, where we are now, and what can be done next.<br>
This is typically the time where we ship features to production too, so we can discuss the feedback we gained from our users too.

<br>

## 5) Sprint retrospective

In our retrospective, we address how frictionless and rewarding the sprint has felt. Everyone gets to rate the sprint on both of these criteria on a scale from 0-10 and explain what they may have struggled with or what they'd like to see improved. We then keep track of these concerns as an issue on Github and pin it to the top of our next sprint board, so we never lose track of it.

<br>

## 6) Repeat

The next day, we start again from the start and continuously improve our experience with the project, so we'll be just as happy as the hundreds of users that we serve ðŸ˜Š
