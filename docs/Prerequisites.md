# Prerequisites

This guide will help you set up everything you need to comfortably work with our stack.

<br>

## Requirements

To run our stack, you'll need

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) in Swarm Mode.
  <br> and
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/cli/install) as npm replacement (it's fast, like really fast)

Don't worry about running things yet, just having them installed is enough.

<br>

## Shortcuts

Make sure you've got your shortcuts for file navigation set up. Looking up files by their name and jumping to references / definitions is a must. The code is split up into many files, but each has a predictable purpose and naming strategy, so you'll know exactly where to find what you look for at any time.

<br>

## Code Style

We use eslint and prettier to enforce our code style. You can save yourself a lot of time by installing their extensions in your editor, as they will automatically adjust your code as needed. For VSCode, we recommend [Prettier ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rvest.vs-code-prettier-eslint).

<br>

## Learning Curve

There is a considerable learning curve to get the hang of things. Don't worry if you can't get things done as quickly as you'd like at first, we all took weeks to get comfortable shipping features without much friction. Just know that in the long run, we save ourselves a lot of time and create consistent high quality, maintainable code.

### We're here to help you out

We appreciate that you want to invest your time into this project, so we want to give some back too!
<br>

In our first weeks together, we typically have pair programming sessions to show you the ropes. Everything from setting up the stack, to your first feature, will be done together.
