# First time Setup

This guide will walk you through the process of getting our stack to run on your dev machine.

<br>

## Operating System

All our code runs on Linux. If you're already on Linux that's great!<br>
If you're on Windows, you can run Linux inside of your Windows via [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

<br>

## Requirements

If you've read the [prerequisites](./Prerequisites.md), you already have these installed and can jump to the next step ðŸ˜Ž

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) in Swarm Mode.
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/cli/install) as npm replacement (it's fast, like really fast)

<br>

## Deployment

To run our stack, you only need to build it once, and then deploy it. The scripts are found in the root directory.
<br>

To build our Docker images:

```sh
bash build.sh [dev/prod/staging]
```

<br>

To deploy the stack to Docker Swarm:

```sh
bash deploy.sh [dev/prod/staging]
```

<br>

## Setting secrets

This is only relevant if you work with services that require secrets, such as Discord bots. (For a full list of requirements, check the table below)
<br>

Secrets can be added with the following command

```sh
printf "your secret" | docker secret create your-secret-name -
```

<br>

## Microservices

If everything is set up correctly, you should see these services with `docker service ls`
