## First Time Setup

If this is your first time working on the stack, you'll definitely want to consider the following, as to not pull your hair out when interacting with the codebase.

<br>

### Shortcuts

Make sure you've got your shortcuts for file navigation set up. Looking up files by their name and jumping to references / definitions is a must. The code is split up into many files, but each has a predictable purpose and naming strategy, so you'll know exactly where to find what you look for at any time.

### Code Style

We use eslint and prettier to enforce our code style. You can save yourself a lot of time by installing their extensions in your editor, as they will automatically adjust your code as needed.

<br>

### Learning Curve

There is a considerable learning curve to get the hang of things. Don't worry if you can't get things done as quickly as you'd like at first, we all took weeks to get comfortable shipping features without much friction. Just know that in the long run, we save ourselves a lot of time and create consistent high quality, maintainable code.
